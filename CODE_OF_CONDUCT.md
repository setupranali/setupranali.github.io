size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender
identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status,
nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual
identity and orientation.

diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

This Code of Conduct also applies when an individual is officially representing
the community in public spaces.

reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:
